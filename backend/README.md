## 2. Automated Report Generation with Charts

## Problem statement
The goal of this project is to create an automated system that allows users to upload documents (PDFs), perform intelligent analysis using AI and external web resources, generate visual insights, and produce a structured PDF report. The system leverages modern AI tools, natural language processing, data visualization, and PDF generation libraries to provide a seamless workflow.

## Features
Upload PDF documents for automated analysis.

Extract text from PDFs using pdfplumber.

Generate embeddings for semantic search and similarity retrieval.

Store embeddings in a vector database for efficient querying.

Summarize content and generate insights using Hugging Face BLOOMZ model.

Enrich analysis with real-time web search via SerpAPI.

Generate charts and visualizations using Plotly Graph Objects.

Convert visualizations to PNG using Kaleido and embed them in PDFs.

Generate professional PDF reports using FPDF.

Provide reports for download or email distribution.
